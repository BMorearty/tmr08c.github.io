A few months ago I was promoted to Lead Software Developer. I had been taking on the responsibilities of a lead developer over the past year and this new title was confirmation I had been handling the responsibilities well. The majority of my new "reports" said they already thought I was the lead developer so within within our development department bubble everything sort of felt the same.

What I didn't think about was the view of outside world looking into our bubble.

My boss has been at my company long enough where everyone in a management position has worked with him for years. They've known him as everything from the wizard that created a macro for them years ago to his current title of the wizard that is the Director of Engineering.

As a staple of my company's engineering department, my boss was generally the one that people went to with questions. This has lessened over time as my presence increased and his availability decreased, but there was still this feeling that if they didn't like my answer they would go to him, his answer held more permanence.

While I talk about it now like it was something that bothered me, in all honesty, I didn't mind having people get the second opinion (especially when it was the same as my own). I liked having that safety net.

With the announcement of my promotion, however, the outside world seemed to have decided that my answers no longer required a second opinion, even if they didn't like what that answer was.

Like Batman in *The Dark Knight Rises*, the lack of having a safety net caused me to do the unthinkable, I began openly answering their questions, and my answers were increasingly becoming "no".

The ability to say no is actually quite powerful and is something that should be used more often by development teams. We all have this desire to make others happy, we want people to like us. Since my clients are also my coworkers, I want to make them to like me even more. This inevitably backfires when I tell everyone I will add every feature request they make. It's okay though, by the time they start asking to see results we will already be best friends!

Saying yes all the time felt nice, but it was a cheap high. I knew I couldn't fulfill everyone's requests and often times knew I *shouldn't* fulfill requests. Saying no has been freeing. Saying no is like eating your vegetables. At first it's tough, and at first you just do it because you know it's the right thing to do, but eventually you get to the point where you wonder how you could have disliked them.

I remember reading somewhere that you shouldn't write down feature requests - the important ones will be impossible to ignore. Changing your default answer to no provides a similar experience. If you say no and the person doesn't argue their point, it must not be too important. If they do argue, you now have a clearer perspective of their request and have a proper discussion about its merits.

While you probably cannot realistically just say no to everything, you most definitely can stop saying yes to everything.

 My original intention of writing this was to say that I unlocked this superpower, the ability to say no, when I leveled up to lead developer. I guess that is still true, but the thing I forgot about leveling up is that it requires that you gain experience points first. I wanted to write about it like I simply [ate a rare candy](http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Rare_Candy) and found I had this new talent. That wasn't the case. Finding the guts to say no takes time, but it's a skill one should strive to achieve. Not only will it help give your team a chance of being successful, but it will also help advance you career by proving you know how to properly manage workloads.

So, please, wield the power of no. Be open and honest with your coworkers and project stakeholders. Let them know when you think something is a bad idea or cannot be done and remember, "when in doubt, no your way out".

Please share you experience of saying no, how did it work for you? Has it helped or hurt?
