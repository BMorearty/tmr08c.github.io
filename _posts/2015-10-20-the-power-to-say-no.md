A few months ago I was promoted to Lead Software Developer. Nothing really changed with the new title, I had essentially taken on the responsibility of a lead developer for the past year or more. To me this title was simply confirmation I hadn't completely screwed up these additional responsibilities. The majority of my new "reports" (new interns for the summer) said they already thought I was a lead so they felt the same as well. In our development department bubble everything was the same.

What I didn't think about was the view of outside world looking into our bubble.

My boss has been at my company long enough where everyone in a management position has worked with him for years. They've known him as everything from the wizard that created a macro for them to his current title of the wizard that is the Director of Engineering. Since they are all so comfortable with him a lot of times they would go directly to him with questions. This has lessened over time as my presence increased and his availability decreased but there was still this feeling that if they didn't like my answer they would go to him, his "no" held more permanence. I talk about it now like it was something that bothered me but in all honesty, I promoted it. I liked having that safety net. However, with the announcement of my promotion, the outside world seemed to have decided that my answers now held more permanence as well.

Like Batman in *The Dark Knight Rises*, the lack of having a safety net caused me to do the unthinkable, I began telling people no.

The ability to say no is actually quite powerful and is something that should be done often by a development team. We all have this desire to make others happy, we want people to like us. Since my clients are also my coworkers I want to make them to like me even more. This inevitably backfires when I tell everyone one I will work on all of their features. It's okay, by the time they start asking to see results  we will already be best friends!

Saying yes all the time felt nice, but it was a cheap high. I knew I couldn't fulfill everyone's requests and often times knew I *shouldn't* fulfill requests. Saying no has been freeing. Saying no is like eating your vegetables. At first it's tough, and at first you just do it because you know it's the right thing to do, but eventually you get to the point where you wonder how you could have disliked them.

I remember reading somewhere that you shouldn't write down feature requests - the important ones will be impossible to ignore. Changing your default answer to no provides a similar experience. If you say no and the person doesn't argue their point it must not be too important. If they do argue, you now have a clearer perspective of their request.

While you probably cannot realistically just say no to everything, you most definitely can stop saying yes to everything.

 My original intention of writing this was to say that I unlocked this superpower, the ability to say no, when I leveled up to lead developer. I guess that is still true but the thing I forgot about leveling up is that it requires that you gain experience points first. I wanted to write about it like I simply [ate a rare candy](http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Rare_Candy) and found I had this new talent. That wasn't the case. Finding the guts to say no takes times but it's a skill one should strive to achieve to not only advance in their career but to give their team any chance of success.

So, please, wield the power of no. Be open and honest with your coworkers and project stakeholders and let them know when you think something is a bad idea or cannot be done. Once you get over that hump you can work on balancing your yes's and your your no's, when it doubt no your way out.

Please share you experience in saying no, how did it work for you? Has it helped or hurt?
