A few months ago I was promoted to Lead Software Developer. This new title change felt largely anti-climatic. Nothing really changed with the new title, I had essentially take on the responsibility of a lead developer for the past year or more, this title was simply confirmation I hadn't done a poor job with these additional responsibilities. Internally I felt the same and the majority of my new "reports" (new interns for the summer) said they already thought I was their manager so they didn't feel any different either. In our development department bubble everything was the same. What I didn't think about was the view from the outside into our bubble.

My boss has been at my company long enough where anyone that is in a management position has worked with him for years, they've known him as everything from the Wizard that created a macro for them to his current title of the wizard that is the Director of Engineering. Since they are all so comfortable with him a lot of times they would go directly to him with questions. This lessened over time as my presence increased and his availability decreased but there was still this feeling that if they didn't like my answer they would go to him, his "no" held more permanence. I actually fault myself for this, I talk about it now like it was something that bothered me but in all honesty I promoted it. I liked having that safety net. With the announcement of my promotion the outside world seemed to have decided that my answers now held more permanence.

The ability to say no is actually quite powerful and is something that needs to be wielded by the development team. We all have this desire to make others happy, we want people to like us. Since my clients are also my coworkers I want to make them like me even more. This inevitably backfires when you tell everyone one you will work on all of their features but that's fine, by the time that comes we will all bes best friends!

Clearly this won't work. In actuality you should really have no be your default answer. I remember reading somewhere that you shouldn't write down feature requests - the important ones will be impossible to avoid. Defaulting to no provides a similar experience. If you say no and the person doesn't argue for their side it must not matter much. If they do argue you should now have a perspective on their request.

Realistically you cannot just say no to everything but you shouldn't be saying yes to everything.

 My original intention of writing this was to say that I unlocked this superpower to say no when I leveled up lead developer. I guess that is still true but the thing I forgot about leveling up is that it requires you gain experience first. I wanted to write about it like I simply [ate a rare candy](http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Rare_Candy) and found I had this new talent. That wasn't the case. I spent years working hard to mastering the knowledge to be able to authoritatively say no and to know when to say no and when to say yes.

Saying no has felt good. Saying yes all the time felt nice but it was a cheap high. I know I couldn't fulfill everyone's requests and often knew I *shouldn't* fulfill some requests. Saying no is like eating your vegetables. At first it's tough, eventually you work your way up to being able to do it because you know it's right, and eventually you go back to the sugary solution that is yes and wonder how you ever managed to have so much of it.
