A few months ago I was promoted to Lead Software Developer. This new title change felt largely anti-climatic. Nothing really changed with the new title, I had essentially take on the responsibility of a lead developer for the past year or more, this title was simply confirmation I hadn't done a poor job with these additional responsibilities. Internally I felt the same and the majority of my new "reports" (new interns for the summer) said they already thought I was their manager so they didn't feel any different either. In our development department bubble everything was the same. What I didn't think about was the view from the outside into our bubble.

It began feeling more and more like team leads were coming to me to ask high level technical decisions.

My boss has been at my company long enough where anyone that is in a management position has worked with him for years, they've known him as everything from the Wizard that created a macro for them to his current title of the wizard that is the Director of Engineering. Since they are all so comfortable with him a lot of times they would go directly to him with questions. This lessened over time as my presence increased and his availability decreased but there was still this feeling that if they didn't like my answer they would go to him, his "no" held more permanence. I actually fault myself for this, I talk about it now like it was something that bothered me but in all honesty I promoted it. I liked having that safety net. My original intention of writing this was to say that I unlcoked this superpower to say no when I leveled up lead developer. I guess that is still true but the thing I forgot about leveling up is that it requires you gain experience first. I wanted to write about it like I simply [ate a rare candy](http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Rare_Candy) and found I had this new talent. That wasn't the case. I spent years working hard to mastering my working domain to the point where when I say "no" it's because it's something we can't/won't/shouldn't do.

They say you should write everyday. I haven't done this like I wanted to but I'm glad I did here. I think in having to actually write out the story to support my thesis ("saying no is a useful power to yield") I actually thought about my story, my full story.
