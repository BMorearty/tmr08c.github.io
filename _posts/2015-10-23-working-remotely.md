My company is based out of Raleigh, North Carolina. For a few years my boss and I were the only members of the company not in Raleigh. We were the Florida Development Team &copy;. The Florida office has grown to include additional developers, a QA engineer, and the break and butter of our company, Internet Marketing Analysts.

I believe I am very fortunate to be able to work on internal applications. Creating products for people you work lends itself very well to following agile practices and all the cool kids follow agile practices.

Through a combination of email, GoToMeeting, and quarterly Raleigh trips we have been able to develop software for our company as though we were in the same building. At least that's what I thought. Our CEO has been reading the [biography of Elon Musk](http://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233) and was inspired by the fact that engineers at companies like SpaceX and Tesla are working **on** the production floors. They are not hiding in their Ivory Towers but on the floor, among the machines they are working to create. This sparked this idea of doing the same at our company. What if our engineers were among the users? Would there be any benefit? With this idea manifesting in the mind of my CEO and wanderlust manifesting within me we found ourselves in a perfect situation for experimentation and as a result I am now writing this from my new home of Raleigh, North Carolina.

## On No Longer Being Remote

*Full disclosure - I wanted my move to have no overall effect on the engineering team. I wanted to be able to use the fact working closer to the users had no effect  as an argument for being able to work remotely or even just work from home occasionally.*

I just wrapped up my third full week in Raleigh and I have to admit that my presence in the office seems to have had an effect on user adoption. Our main tool is a complex application that allows users to set up various tasks that can be tweaked via numerous settings. Our tool shines in that after some initial work it essentially allows the user to set it and forget. The problem is that often times our users shy away from that initial investment time and try to do the work by hand, taking more time and missing out on the maintenance aspect our tool provides.

Having me in the office has allowed users to offload some of that initial set up process to me. This has been beneficial for a few reasons. As a developer of the software I love seeing people use what I helped build so if I can get them using our tools I consider that a win. The other benefit is I am able to learn how the tool is being used. I am able to find where the users are getting confused, what they want to do, and where our tool falls short. I am also able to use some backend voodoo and my local server to provide a quick, temporary solution when we don't have the time to full develop a feature.

Even though my coworkers have been able to email me or even dial 3 digits to page my phone seeing me in the office seems to have reminded them of all the tasks they want to use our tools to do. Now a trip to refill on water can turn into a discussion about that one option they always wondered about.

Despite the fact that my secret goal of having no real effect on our users didn't come true it has actually been very rewarding to see this effect take place. It is great to see adoption rise, especially when more complicated tasks are being set up, taking advantage of the years of work we have put into our software.

## On Being More Remote Than Before

One thing that is interesting about my situation is that while I have in one sense stopped being remote, I am now working closer with the user of our tools. In another sense I am even more remote than before. I am the only member of my team that is in Raleigh, the rest of my team is still working out of Florida.

I actually thought up the idea to write this post less than two weeks into my move. I found I was spending way more time writing up Github comments. For some reason we had two branches in a row that evolved into these long design discussions. I was spending 10-15 minutes writing up my opinion on the situation knowing that it still wouldn't be resolved, I would at least need the opinion of the code's author and in both cases there was at least one additional developers involved in conversation. I was feeling discouraged. Normally I enjoyed these conversations but when they were in person they didn't *seem* to take as long.

After these two big debates discussions went back to normal and I didn't find myself writing up multiple 15 minutes long code review comments any more.

This week I decided to set up a few one on one sessions with members of my team to see how my displacement was affecting them. Again, full disclosure, my hypothesis was they would say they felt communication has suffered and they missed the ability to just look up from the computer and discuss any issues. To my surprise one of the responses I received was "I actually think communication is better". This was surprising to me but when the elaborated it made sense. It was universal that everyone like the more detailed Github discussions. They liked having something in writing to back to when making changes. This is especially useful because a large portion of my team our interns that are working part time between classes. They said the found they were able to ramp up quicker by rereading previous conversations.
