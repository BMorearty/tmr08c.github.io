My company is based out of Raleigh, North Carolina. For a few years my boss and I were the only members of the company not in Raleigh. We were the Florida Development Team &copy;. The Florida office has grown to include additional developers, a QA engineer, and the break and butter of our company, Internet Marketing Analysts.

I believe I am very fortunate to be able to work on internal applications. Creating products for people you work lends itself very well to following agile practices and all the cool kids follow agile practices.

Through a combination of email, GoToMeeting, and quartely Raleigh trips we have been able to develop software for our company as though we were in the same building. At least that's what I thought. Our CEO has been reading the [biography of Elon Muske]() and was inspire by the fact that engineers are companies like SpaceX and Tesla are working on the production floors. They are not hiding in their Ivory Towers but on the floor, among the machines they are working to create.
