Recently, a former co-worker to join a weekly "life retro" that a few of my old teammates have been running. Seemingly similar to a [mastermind group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group), they have been using the retro format we used for our sprints to talk about how their lives are going. Specifically, they would go around and ask "what went well that we want to keep doing" and "what went poorly that we want to do differently."

My answer to what went poorly was that I fell victim to the trap of not taking breaks because I wanted to get more done. I was feeling behind where I wanted to be on my initiative at work and realized I tried to "fix" the problem by spending more of my day working. This meant I took shorter lunch breaks (some of them at my desk) and avoided the regularly short dog walking breaks I get to take throughout the day. This is far from the first time I have tried taking this approach and, sadly, even though I am writing myself a blog post to remember to do otherwise, it probably will not be the last. Despite countless reminders to "work smarter not harder" when a deadline is approaching or things are going according to plan, it is easy to fall into a mindset of throwing more time at a time. Admittedly, there may be time this is necessary and, in short bursts, it can definitely work. While I struggle with knowing where the line is, I believe there is some benefit to deadlines. If an occasional looming deadline causes me to cut back on a some work activities or work a longer day or two, it can feel more rewarding to hit the goal. The key word here is "occasional." Continuous stress and strain is counterproductive - not only is the quality of work reduced, but the unhappiness I feel about my working environment seems to linger past when my brain has recovered.
