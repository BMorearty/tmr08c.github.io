I was recently invited to join a weekly "life retro" that a few of my old teammates have been running. Seemingly similar to a [mastermind group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group), they have been using the retro format we used for our sprints to talk about how their lives are going. Specifically, they ask "what went well that we want to keep doing" and "what went poorly that we want to do differently."

During my first session, my answer to what went poorly was that I fell victim to the trap of not taking breaks because I wanted to get more done. I was feeling behind where I wanted to be on my initiative at work and realized I tried to "fix" the problem by spending more of my day working. This meant I took shorter lunch breaks (many of them at my desk) and avoided the regularly short dog walking breaks I get to take throughout the day.

This is far from the first time I have tried taking this approach and, sadly, even though I am writing myself a blog post to remember to do otherwise, it probably will not be the last. Despite countless reminders to "work smarter not harder," when a deadline is approaching or things are not going according to plan, it is easy to fall into a mindset of throwing more time at the problem. Admittedly, there may be situations when this is necessary and, in short bursts, it can definitely work.

# The Right Amount of Pressure

While I struggle with knowing where the line is, I believe there is some benefit to deadlines. If an occasional looming deadline causes me to cut back on a some work activities or work a longer day or two, it can feel more rewarding to hit the goal. The key word here is "occasional." Continuous stress and strain is counterproductive - not only is the quality of work reduced, but the unhappiness I feel about my working environment seems to linger past when my brain has recovered. This balancing act aligns with the [Yerkes-Dodson law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law).

> The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance decreases.

Often represented as a bell curve, there appears to be peak-levels of arousal (stress, pressure, excitement) beyond which your performance will decrease.

While not scientifically measured, during the retro, I shared feeling of moving beyond the peak of the curve and into suboptimal performance. This is where the second half of the "what went poorly" question (and do I want to do differently) and the topic of this post come in.

In short, I want to make sure that I am taking regular breaks.

# Breaks

## What's not in a Break?

To start, it can be useful to identify what a break is. I try to subscribe to the [Newportian](https://www.calnewport.com/) idea of [deep breaks](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/14/on-deep-breaks/). If you read the post about deep breaks, you may notice that it is less about what a deep break _is_ and more about what it _isn't_. The goal of this style of break is to avoid switching to tasks that will leave [attention residue](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/06/a-productivity-lesson-from-a-classic-arcade-game/). Attention residue occurs when switching between tasks, especially cognitively demanding tasks. When you move your attention to a task some "residue" seems to stick around in your brain and make fully re-engaging with the first task more difficult.

When taking a break, you want to avoid anything that can capture your brain's attention away from what you are working on. A trap I personally fall into is the quick check of my email inbox or chat notifications. While I may actually only spend less than five minutes scanning my inbox, there is a high probability of there being at least one email that will gnaw at the back of my mind when I am resuming my original work.

If you are already worried about getting enough work done, you may feel hamstrung by the idea of removing work-related tasks from your "break" time. While it may feel counterproductive, you should find this single-tasking strategy allows you to produce better work on the task at hand and often at a faster rate.

## ..then what is in a break?

If you buy into the premise that taking breaks helps prevent a deterioration in your work performance (Yerkes-Dodson law) and that breaks should avoid simply refocusing your attention on other tasks (deep breaks), then you may wonder what you _should_ do with your breaks.

To start, we can turn to [dieting advice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/to-lose-weight-dont-just-avoid-temptation-remove-it/2018/10/26/eeb48238-d87f-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html): "don't resist temptation, remove it." Knowing that we want to avoid using our break time to change where our brain power if focused, I find my best breaks are when I step away from the distractions that my computer can bring. Once you are away from your computer there is a lot you can do, including nothing. It is perfectly valid to just sit in a chair and stare off for ten minutes.

Since shifting to remote work, I have found a number of go-to tasks that fit well into a ten to fifteen minute break such as cleaning up a few dishes or starting a load of laundry. These small household tasks work well because they don't shift my deep work attention away to another hard problem, I don't really enjoy doing them so I'm not going take more time than necessary, and they contribute to the [positive psychological effects of cleanliness and organization](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-truisms-wellness/201607/the-powerful-psychology-behind-cleanliness). Those positive effects aside, my favorite of all of the break-time activities is getting outside and walking. Walking has [many benefits](https://www.hustleescape.com/productivity-benefits-of-walking/) and spending as little as [five minutes in nature can improve self-esteem and mood](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190304-why-walking-makes-you-a-better-worker), so it's not surprising I am happier when my day includes a walk.

## Making Time

If you are now bought into the idea of taking breaks and have some ideas of what you want to do on the break, we now come to the my retrospective takeaway: how do we keep up our break-taking habit, even (and especially) in times of stress?

### Understand the benefits

For some people, knowing the benefits of their actions (or intended actions) can help them commit to their practices. You can use the benefits outlined above to help kickstart your break-taking routine and serve as a reminder to stay on track. Since starting to write this post and reading the break-related research, I found a renewed break-taking vigor.

### Implementation Intention

[Implementation intention](https://jamesclear.com/implementation-intentions) is the idea of planning an action (an intention) at a particular time or situation (the implementation). It can be thought of as an `if` statement. In the linked post, James Clear suggests using the template

```
I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]
```

put another way,

```ruby
if Time.now == TIME && me.current_location == LOCATION
  me.do(BEHAVIOR)
end
```

We can use this template to plan when we want to take a daily break. As an example, "I will [take a 15 minute walking break] at [12:30] in [my neighborhood]".

Being specific is a key aspect to this practice. From the article,

> Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. (...) When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.

#### Habit Stacking

A special form of implementation intention is [habit stacking](https://jamesclear.com/habit-stacking). Habit stacking uses the idea of specifying your intention, but ties the _when_ aspect to an existing habit.

[The Pomodoro&reg; Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) is a perfect example of this strategy. The general algorithm for the technique is:

1. I will choose some work to do
1. After I choose some work, I will set a time
1. After I set a timer, I will start working
1. After the timer goes off, I will take a break

Rather than determining an exact time for your work or break, you base your actions on the previous step you took (with the helpful guidance of a timer).

While not a habit in the way we normally talk about them, meetings can also provide excellent anchors for your habit stacking. Consider the following, "After I am done with stand up, I will take a 15 minute walking break." I like tying activities to meetings because I know I will already have context switched out of my coding project for the day. Breaking after a meeting can help clear out some of the attention residue as I begin getting into the problem headspace.

#### Time-block Planning

Inspired by [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/)'s release of a [time-block planner](https://www.timeblockplanner.com/), I have been experimenting with using his form of time-block planning.

Time-block planning leverages the psychological effects of implementation intentions by pre-scheduling your time for your entire working day. You can use your clear-headed planning brain to set good intentions for your frazzled, middle-of-the-day brain.

One intention I have been trying to set for myself is a full, mid-day lunch break. Taking a break in the middle of the day can be difficult to time just right with habit stacking. This is where I have found time-block planning to shine. Knowing I plan to stop at a certain time will impact the decisions I make as the time draws nearer. Some days, this may mean I don't start a new task and break early and other days it could mean I move my break back to let me keep up with my flow state. Despite rearranging my schedule, I have found that I am taking full lunch breaks away from my desk more often.

You don't have to go full time-block plannig to set an intention to take a regular lunch break. Thoughout my career I have come across many people that have a recurring lunchtime break on their work calendar; this provides the same intention settings and has the added bonus or preventing others from scheduling during your allotted break time.

# Conclusion

Finding balance is difficult. It can be even more difficult on a day-to-day basis when you are focused on getting your work done.

While systems and habits can help you to follow best practices that you set up for yourself, they need to be maintained and reviewed to ensure effectiveness. Retrospectives can provide a means for this review and evaluation. Periodically checking in with yourself can do wonders for keeping you on a well-balanced path throughout your life and career.

While there is a draw to set it and forget it techniques, I have found I periodically need to un-forget and make sure things are working for me. In this case, I needed to see the negative effects that not taking breaks was having on me and use that pain to harden some of my best practices.
