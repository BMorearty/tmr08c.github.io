I was recently invited to join a weekly "life retro" that a few of my old teammates have been running. Seemingly similar to a [mastermind group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group), they have been using the retro format we used for our sprints to talk about how their lives are going. Specifically, they ask "what went well that we want to keep doing" and "what went poorly that we want to do differently."

My answer to what went poorly was that I fell victim to the trap of not taking breaks because I wanted to get more done. I was feeling behind where I wanted to be on my initiative at work and realized I tried to "fix" the problem by spending more of my day working. This meant I took shorter lunch breaks (some of them at my desk) and avoided the regularly short dog walking breaks I get to take throughout the day.

This is far from the first time I have tried taking this approach and, sadly, even though I am writing myself a blog post to remember to do otherwise, it probably will not be the last. Despite countless reminders to "work smarter not harder," when a deadline is approaching or things are not going according to plan, it is easy to fall into a mindset of throwing more time at the problem. Admittedly, there may be situations when this is necessary and, in short bursts, it can definitely work.

While I struggle with knowing where the line is, I believe there is some benefit to deadlines. If an occasional looming deadline causes me to cut back on a some work activities or work a longer day or two, it can feel more rewarding to hit the goal. The key word here is "occasional." Continuous stress and strain is counterproductive - not only is the quality of work reduced, but the unhappiness I feel about my working environment seems to linger past when my brain has recovered. This balancing act aligns with the [Yerkes-Dodson law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law).

> The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance decreases.

Often represented as a bell curve, there appears to be peak-levels of arousal (stress, pressure, excitement) beyond which your performance will decrease.

While not scientifically measured, during the retro, I shared feeling of moving beyond the peak of the curve and into suboptimal performance. This is where the second half of the "what went poorly" question (and do I want to do differently) and the topic of this post come in.

In short, I want to make sure that I am taking regular breaks.

To start, it can be useful to identify what a break is. I try to subscribe to the [Newportian](https://www.calnewport.com/) idea of [deep breaks](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/14/on-deep-breaks/). If you read the post about deep breaks, you may notice that it is less about what a deep break _is_ and more about what it _isn't_. The goal of this style of break is to avoid switching to tasks that will leave [attention residue](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/06/a-productivity-lesson-from-a-classic-arcade-game/). Attention residue occurs when switching between tasks, especially cognitively demanding tasks. When you move your attention to another task some "residue" seems to stick in your brain and make fully re-engaging more difficult when you try to resume your first task.

When taking a break, you want to avoid anything that can capture your brain's attention away from what you are working on. A trap I personally fall into is the quick check of my email inbox or chat notifications. While I may actually only spend a few minutes scanning my inbox, there is a high probability of there being at least one email that will gnaw at the back of my mind when I am resuming my original work.

If you are already worried about getting enough work done, you may feel hamstrung by the idea of removing work-related tasks from your "break" time. While it may feel counterproductive, you should find this single-tasking strategy allows you to produce better work on the task at hand and often at a faster rate.

If you buy into the premise that taking breaks helps prevent a deterioration in your work performance (Yerkes-Dodson law) and that breaks should avoid simply refocusing your attention on other tasks (deep breaks), then you may wonder what you _should_ do with your breaks.

To start, we can turn to [dieting advice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/to-lose-weight-dont-just-avoid-temptation-remove-it/2018/10/26/eeb48238-d87f-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html): "don't resist temptation, remove it." Knowing that we want to avoid using our break time to change where our brain power if focused, I find my best breaks are when I step away from the distractions that my computer can bring. Once you are away from your computer there is a lot you can do, including nothing. It is perfectly valid to just sit in a chair and stare off for ten minutes.

Since shifting to remote work, I have found a number of go-to tasks that fit well into a ten to fifteen minute break such as cleaning up a few dishes or starting a load of laundry. These small household tasks work well because they don't shift my deep work attention away to another hard problem, I don't really enjoy doing them so I'm not going take more time than necessary, and they contribute to the [positive psychological effects of cleanliness and organization](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-truisms-wellness/201607/the-powerful-psychology-behind-cleanliness). Those positive effects aside, my favorite of all of the break-time activities is getting outside and walking. Walking has [many benefits](https://www.hustleescape.com/productivity-benefits-of-walking/) and spending as little as [five minutes in nature can improve self-esteem and mood](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190304-why-walking-makes-you-a-better-worker), so it's not surprising I am happier when my day includes a walk.

## Making Time

If you are now bought into the idea of taking breaks and have some ideas of what you want to do on the break, we now come to the my retrospective takeawy: how do we keep up our break-taking habit, even (and especially) in times of stress?

### Understand the benefits

The retro discussion still in my head, I found I had an old [topic card](https://github.com/tmr08c/tmr08c.github.io/issues/75) title "taking breaks" and thought I would resurrect that topic with the spin of having recently had a week with fewer breaks. However, as I began writing, I found I wanted to cite sources that backed the vauge notion in my head of "breaks are good" and "work harder not smarter." Finding this information has made these hand-wavy, feel-good ideas turn into something more scientific and "real." I acknowledge I am playing into [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) (I literally Googled phrases like "benefits of breaks"). Forutnately, in just now Googling "negative side effects work breaks," most first page results were about the negative effects of _not_ taking breaks and the only result that seemed to be about the bad effects of a break are when that break is a smoking break.

This shifted away from the original topic card which was more about using "breaks" (really just, not sitting at the computer) to get through difficult problems

And this takes us back to my answer of what I want to change. I don't want to fall on the wrong side of the Yerkes-Dodson curve due to stress and worry. I want to maintain a steady practice of deep break routines that allow me to not only be more productive, but also lead a healtheir and happier life.
