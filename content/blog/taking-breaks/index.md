I was recently invited to join a weekly "life retro" that a few of my old teammates have been running. Seemingly similar to a [mastermind group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group), they have been using the retro format we used for our sprints to talk about how their lives are going. Specifically, they ask "what went well that we want to keep doing" and "what went poorly that we want to do differently."

My answer to what went poorly was that I fell victim to the trap of not taking breaks because I wanted to get more done. I was feeling behind where I wanted to be on my initiative at work and realized I tried to "fix" the problem by spending more of my day working. This meant I took shorter lunch breaks (some of them at my desk) and avoided the regularly short dog walking breaks I get to take throughout the day.

This is far from the first time I have tried taking this approach and, sadly, even though I am writing myself a blog post to remember to do otherwise, it probably will not be the last. Despite countless reminders to "work smarter not harder," when a deadline is approaching or things are not going according to plan, it is easy to fall into a mindset of throwing more time at the problem. Admittedly, there may be situations when this is necessary and, in short bursts, it can definitely work.

While I struggle with knowing where the line is, I believe there is some benefit to deadlines. If an occasional looming deadline causes me to cut back on a some work activities or work a longer day or two, it can feel more rewarding to hit the goal. The key word here is "occasional." Continuous stress and strain is counterproductive - not only is the quality of work reduced, but the unhappiness I feel about my working environment seems to linger past when my brain has recovered. This balancing act aligns with the [Yerkes-Dodson law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law).

> The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance decreases.

Often represented as a bell curve, there appears to be peak-levels of arousal (stress, pressure, excitement) beyond which your performance will decrease.

While not scientifically measured, during the retro, I shared feeling of moving beyond the peak of the curve and into suboptimal performance. This is where the second half of the "what went poorly" question (and do I want to do differently) and the topic of this post come in.

In short, I want to make sure that I am taking regular breaks.

To start, it can be useful to identify what a break is. I try to subscribe to the [Newportian](https://www.calnewport.com/) idea of [deep breaks](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/14/on-deep-breaks/). If you read the post about deep breaks, you may notice that it is less about what a deep break _is_ and more about what it _isn't_. The goal of this style of break is to avoid switching to tasks that will leave [attention residue](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/06/a-productivity-lesson-from-a-classic-arcade-game/). Attention residue occurs when switch between tasks, especially cognitively demanding tasks. When you switch you attention to another task some "residue" seems to stick in your brain and making fully re-engaging more difficult when you try to switch back to your first task.

When taking a break, you want to avoid anything that can capture your brain's attention away from what you are working on. A trap I personally fall into is the quick check of my e-mail inbox or chat notifications. While I may actually only spend a few minutes scanning my inbox, there is a high probability of there being at least one e-mail that will gnaw at the back of my mind. The culprit is often GitHub notifications where I start trying to think of how to respond to feedback left on a pull request.

This limitation on what a break is may worsen your feeling counterproductivity - if your break is checking email, at least you feel like you are still getting some work done. What we are working to do is shift our mindset from quantity of work (hours of butt-in-seat time), to quality of work.

As the [dieting advice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/to-lose-weight-dont-just-avoid-temptation-remove-it/2018/10/26/eeb48238-d87f-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html) goes, "don't resist temptation, remove it." Knowing that we want to avoid using our break time to change where our brain power if focused, I find my best breaks are when I step away from the distractions that my computer can bring. This is where I think working from home has really shone for me. I can easily take a super quick, grab some water and get back to work, break, but I also have a number of go-to tasks that fit well into a ten to fifteen minute break such as cleaning up a few dishes or starting a load of laundry. These small household tasks work well because they don't shift my deep work attention away to another hard problem, I don't really _enjoy_ doing them so I'm not going take more time than necessary, and they contribute to the [positive psychological effects of cleanliness and organization](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-truisms-wellness/201607/the-powerful-psychology-behind-cleanliness). My favorite of all of the break-time activities is getting outside and walking. Walking as [many benefits](https://www.hustleescape.com/productivity-benefits-of-walking/) and spending as little as [five minutes in nature can improve self-esteem and mood](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190304-why-walking-makes-you-a-better-worker), so it's not surprising I am happier when my day includes a walk.

And this takes us back to my answer of what I want to change. I don't want to fall on the wrong side of the Yerkes-Dodson curve due to stress and worry. I want to maintain a steady practice of deep break routines that allow me to not only be more productive, but also lead a healtheir and happier life.
