In my introduction to programming course, we were told to add comments to every function we wrote. Literally. Being new to programming and struggling to get simple `for` loops to work, I expect most of the comments I added were mostly useless. A common problem I believe school projects is have is how temporary they are. Most projects I had were worked on only by me, for a few weeks, and never revisited. With this style of project, I rarely found value in comments. As a result, as the tyranny of required comments was lifted, I found the habit of using them didn't keep up.

Thie idea behid self-documenting code is you want to favor writing code in a style that is easy to read and does not require line-by-line comments explaining what is going on.
