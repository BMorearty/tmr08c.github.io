When I reflect on my career as a software developer to this point I realize I owe everything to the fact that I had an internship in college. In my case, this internship would lead to a full-time job where I would spend nearly eight years learning how to be a professional software developer, project leader, and people manager. However, after helping to run the internship program at that same company for multiple years, I am confident that the internship would have been valuable even if I didn't end up with a job offer.

This post is mostly aimed at those interested in becoming software developers through attending college. While I don't think college is the only way to become a developer, I believe options such as boot camps intend to have you be job-ready by the end and do not have time gaps that you can fill with an internship. If you land a full-time job after something like a boot camp, then you are probably better off than trying to first find an internship. Regardless of your situation, if you are considering seeking an internship (or think you should) this post can hopefully provide some insights into the benefits of internships and help you in your decision-making process.

## 1. Seek internship opportunities as soon as possible

From my experience, the summer between junior and senior year is the primary time students seek internships. However, one of my biggest professional regrets it not applying for internships sooner If I could do things over, I would start looking as early as Freshman year. While I was fortunate and converted my internship into a job I enjoyed, the odds usually aren't on your side. Not only was I playing against the odds, but I also missed out on the opportunity to gain more, diverse experiences by participating in multiple internship programs.

While I know I was not internship-worthy as a Freshman, I know applying still would have been valuable. Even if you do not end up getting an internship, you will gain a lot by simply going through the application process. You will learn a key life skill: how to apply for jobs. These lessons include how to find job opportunities, writing cover letters, and tweaking your resume. Eventually, you will also learn about how to interview. Starting the process earlier, in a lower-stakes environment makes it easier in the future when you find yourself looking for full-time opportunities.

## 2. You are interviewing the company too

Internships provide a non-committal working relationship for both you as the intern and the company that has hired you. Companies take advantage of this fact and use internships as a way to take a low-risk chance on inexperienced workers with the goal of finding strong full-time candidates. You should take advantage of this relationship as well and use internships to "play the field" and learn about the type of work you want to do in the future.

While there are too many variables at play to test all combinations of working conditions, if you are lucky enough to have two internships you can hopefully start to find trends that you like and don't like in companies. Consider being strategic in your internship choices and seek opportunities that would provide you with some variety (large vs. small company/team, different types of applications, different software development practices, remote vs. in-office, etc.).

## 3. Not all internships are created equal

When looking for internship opportunities it's important to know that not all internship programs are run the same way. Take some time to understand how the company will run the program and make sure that aligns with your goals.

As an example, the internship programs that I ran were generally made up of a small cohort of interns (2-4) and would involve working on the same tasks our full-time team would be working on.

For our first few cohorts (including the one I joined as an intern) we would start with self-guided education to learn how to work with out tech stack. After a week or two of tutorials, we would start assigning work that would increase in difficulty (providing guidance as needed).

Our program evolved to be more centered around [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). Our most recent cohorts would, on day two (day one was usually HR stuff, meeting the team, getting computer set up), join one of our full-time developers and start pairing. For the first few sprints we usually have the full-time team member drive, but found our interns usually wanted to get their hands on the wheel pretty quickly. Our pairing schedule would start with assigned pairs until the interns had a chance to work with everyone on the team. At that point, we would move more into how the team normally worked - forming pairs on a more ad hoc basis based on the work being done

Our transition to focusing on pair programming came out of our team's workflow changes to always pair. Changing how we ran the internship to match how we worked as a team allowed us to stay aligned with our goal of providing interns with the experience of exactly how they would work on our team. We followed the same onboarding workflows for new full-time hires as we did interns.

Whether a team follows a dogmatic approach to pairing or doesn't do it at all, it is a very powerful tool for helping train new hires to the team. When seeking internships I would highly recommend finding opportunities that include pair programming, or at least let you work closely with more experienced team members. When getting started, pairing is a form of shadowing, something common across industries. Pairing as a new hire helps you learn about the team, the applications, the company, common workflows and tools, and more. You get to see first hand how people on the team work. If pairing isn't a default option, consider asking members of the team to join them for a few coding sessions early on in the program; it will boost your productivity for the remainder of the internship.

Another internship style that I have heard about, but not experienced directly, includes having intern-specific projects. These could be projects that you work on solo or as a group and are generally projects not directly related to the team's main application. While I have a slight bias towards the advantage of getting to work on production code directly with the team that maintains it, this style of internship is still valuable. If you are focused on one project throughout the course of an internship, it will likely end up being the first time you've worked on a project for so long and become of of the biggest projects you've been a part of. This is one of the biggest benefits of internships - you learn about working with and maintaining code. School projects are often about solving the problem and turning in the assignment. When you are working with code professionally, you learn how important it is to focus on the ability to debug and maintain the code you write. You can learn about this in theory, but I've found that "best practices" really stick with me when I don't follow them and feel the pain, or follow them and come back to a project and see the benefits. Working on your own project for an extended period of time can help reveal these costs and benefits to you.

We've touched on some of the professional experience and career advantages gained from internships - learning how professional software developers work, experiencing working on a long term project, interview practice, learning about the type of company you would like to work for, etc. If you are early in your schooling, it may feel like this could all wait, you may be focused on just trying to deal with getting used to school. Even if that's the case, I believe internships can still help you! For the most part, many of the career-related advantages you would gain out of an internship will also help you in your schooling. One of the reasons I wish I joined an internship earlier is that I think it would have helped me come back a much stronger student. While I believe schools teach it now, version control was something I only learned about after joining my internship. Using git alone would have saves me hours of stress and frustration during my schooling. There are dozens of these sort of things that you pick up when working with people that have been doing this job for years - from how to use tools like version control, editors, and debuggers, to workflow changes like knowing when to commit, how to break down work, and review your work, to game-changers like learning how to write tests, learning about new languages and libraries, and learning how to become a better Googler. While taking a Summer semester off may slow down how many credits you are earning, I think it will pay itself off in how much stronger of a student you will becomes.

Something else you can gain through an internship that will help in all aspects of your life is confidence. When I joined my internship, all I new was how to be a student. I didn't know what it would be like to be a 9-5 office worker and I definitely didn't know if I had what it takes to be a _real_ programmer. In retrospect, I imagine part of the reason I didn't seek an internship sooner was fear: What if I wasn't good enough? What if I didn't programming when doing it eight hours a day? Thinking about this now, I realize how backwards this thought process was - if I wasn't sure about my impending career choice I should have tested that theory as soon as possible. While not fun, it's easier to change majors when you are  still actually **in** school (especially when compared to trying to do that after you've already graduated). The transition from school to "real life" is challenging. Like many things that are difficult, it becomes easier if you can practice. In this case, practice can be joining an internship. In an ideal case, you will gain confidence in knowing you can find, apply for, and excel in a job. That will definitely be a confidence booster when coming back to school or applying in the future. Even non-ideal cases can have their benefits - you may not get accepted to any internships, but gain experience dealing with rejection, or you may find confidence in being able to narrow your focus by learning what you **don't** want to do with your career, whether that's working at a certain type of company, with a certain type of tech stack, or programming in general.

I know it's scary. I know it's not going to be easy. But, if you are able to, please consider applying for internship programs. It will change your life.
