There are many reasons those of us in the software development field are lucky. One of these reasons is that when getting into the field we have the opportuntiy to join internships and, unlike some fields, these internships are often (well) paid. However, this post insn't pitching internships for the monetary value (though, that shouldn't be ignored). Instead, this post is about the long-term career value you get out of internships.

When I reflect on my career as a software developer so far, I realize I owe everything to the fact that I attended a job fair and landed an internship. In my case, this internship would lead to a full-time job where I would spend nearly eight years learning how to be a professional software developer, project leader, and people manager. After helping to run an internship program at that same company for multiple years, I now believe that the internship would have been valuable even if I didn't end up with a job offer.

This post is mostly aimed at those interested in becoming software developers through attending college. While I don't think college is the only way to become a developer, I believe options such as bootcamps intend to have you be job-ready by the end. If you land a full-time job after something like a bootcamp, then you are probably better off than trying to first find an internship. However, everyone's situation is different. Hopefully, this post can provide some additional insights into the benefits of internships and help you in your decision-making journey.

From my experience, it seems like the summer between junior and senior year is a big time for interns. However, if I could do things over again, I would start looking as early as Freshman year. Even though I doubt I would have been very valuable to a company, I would have gained immense value out of simploy learning how to apply and, if I was lucky, interview for an internship (which would help get me ready for applying for jobs). One of my biggest professional regrets it not getting an internship sooner. While I was fortunate and converted my internship into a job I enjoyed, the odds usually aren't on your side. Not only was I playing against the odds, but I also missed out on the opportunitity to gain more, diverse experiences.

For internship programs I have helped to run, we have had successful interns that were coming out of their Sophmore year, so don't feel intimidated by being early in your college career. Even if you do not end up getting an internship for that summer, you will gain a lot from going through the process. You will learn how to apply for jobs - this includes how to find job opportunities, writing cover letters, and tweaking your resume. In some cases, you will also learn about how to interview. You will likely even have a variety of different style interviews inclding phone screens, video calls, technical interviews at a whiteboard or through a web application, interviews with engineerings, interviews with HR representatives. Use all of these as feedback mechanisms. Learn the types of questions that are asked and spend some time thinking about your replies (you don't want to go full-scripted, but try to have some high-points you want to hit), try to run some post-interview analysis to think about what is working and what isn't.
