There are many reasons those of us in the software development field are lucky. One of these reasons is that when getting into the field we have the opportuntiy to join internships and, unlike some fields, these internships are often (well) paid. However, this post insn't pitching internships for the monetary value (though, that shouldn't be ignored). Instead, this post is about the long-term career value you get out of internships.

When I reflect on my career as a software developer so far, I realize I owe everything to the fact that I attended a job fair and landed an internship. In my case, this internship would lead to a full-time job where I would spend nearly eight years learning how to be a professional software developer, project leader, and people manager. After helping to run an internship program at that same company for multiple years, I now believe that the internship would have been valuable even if I didn't end up with a job offer.

This post is mostly aimed at those interested in becoming software developers through attending college. While I don't think college is the only way to become a developer, I believe options such as bootcamps intend to have you be job-ready by the end. If you land a full-time job after something like a bootcamp, then you are probably better off than trying to first find an internship. However, everyone's situation is different. Hopefully, this post can provide some additional insights into the benefits of internships and help you in your decision-making journey.

From my experience, it seems like the summer between junior and senior year is a big time for interns. However, if I could do things over again, I would start looking as early as Freshman year. Even though I doubt I would have been very valuable to a company, I would have gained immense value out of simploy learning how to apply and, if I was lucky, interview for an internship (which would help get me ready for applying for jobs). One of my biggest professional regrets it not getting an internship sooner. While I was fortunate and converted my internship into a job I enjoyed, the odds usually aren't on your side. Not only was I playing against the odds, but I also missed out on the opportunitity to gain more, diverse experiences.

For internship programs I have helped to run, we have had successful interns that were coming out of their Sophmore year, so don't feel intimidated by being early in your college career. Even if you do not end up getting an internship for that summer, you will gain a lot from going through the process. You will learn how to apply for jobs - this includes how to find job opportunities, writing cover letters, and tweaking your resume. In some cases, you will also learn about how to interview. You will likely even have a variety of different style interviews inclding phone screens, video calls, technical interviews at a whiteboard or through a web application, interviews with engineerings, interviews with HR representatives. Use all of these as feedback mechanisms. Learn the types of questions that are asked and spend some time thinking about your replies (you don't want to go full-scripted, but try to have some high-points you want to hit), try to run some post-interview analysis to think about what is working and what isn't. Starting the process earlier, in a lower-stakes envrionment makes it easier in the future when you find yourself looking for full-time opportunities.

While we talked about the actual interview process, internships can sometimes be thought of as extended interviews. It is a way for a company to work with someone, generally with less experience, and see if they could work as a full-time employee. However, this doesn't only apply to the company, this can apply to you "interviewing" the company as well. 

Internships provide a way to try working for a company without fully committing. If you are able to start early enough, you can more generally explore the _type_ of company you want to work for. There are too many variables at play to try everything, but if you are lucky enough to have two internships you can hopefully start to find trends that you like and don't like in companies. If you can, try to be strategic with your internships and find opportunities that would provide you with some variety. This may not always be possible, but aftre your first internship, consider trying to more heavily target companies of a different type (large vs. small, different types of applications, different software development practices, remote vs. in-office, etc.). 

When looking for internship opportunities it's important to know that not all internship programs are run the same way. Take some time to understand how the company will run the program and make sure that aligns with your goals. For example, internship programs that I ran were generally made up of a small cohort of interns (2-4) and would invovle working on the same stuff our full-time team would be working on. Our first few cohorts would generally start out going through some education materials to learn about our stack and then we would start assigning work that would increase in difficulty (providing guidance as needed). This evolved to be more centered around pairing. Our most recent cohorts would, on day two (day one was usually HR stuff, meeting the team, getting computer set up), join one of our full-time developers and start pairing with a full-time team member. For the first few sprints we usually have the full-time team member drive, but found our interns usually wanted to get their hands on the wheel pretty quickly. Our pairing schedule would start with assigned pairs until the interns had a chance to work with everyone on the team. At that point, we would move more into how the team normally worked - forming pairs on a more ad hoc basis based on the work being done. Our goal was to provide interns with real experience into exactly how they would work on our team. This would be the same process we would have for a new full-time employee. 

Pair programming is a power training technique. In addition to coding...tools

Another internship styles that I have heard about (but not experienced directly) include having intern-specific projects. These could be projects that you work on solo or as a group. These are generally projects not directly related to the team's main application. While I have a slight bias towards the advantage of getting to work on production code directly with the team that maintains it, this style of internship has some advantes as well. If you are focused on one project throughout the course of an internship, it will likely end up being the first time you've worked on a project that long and become of of the biggest projects you've been a part of. This is one of the biggest benefits of internships - you learn what about working with and maintaing code. School projects are often about solving the problem and turning in the assignment. When you are working with code professionally, you learn how important it is to focus on the ability to debug and maintain the code you write. You can learn about this in theory, but I've found that "best practices" really stick for me when I don't follow them and feel the pain, or follow them and come back to a project and see the benefits.
