Despite being a compiled language, Elixir has provided support for executing code in file as though it were a scripting language since it's inception. By using the `.exs` extension, Elixir will compile the file in-memory and run the compiled code.

As a simple example, we can create a file, `my_script.exs` to print something "Hello, World"-like.

```elixir
# my_script.exs
IO.puts("Hello, from Elixir")
IO.puts("...a scripting language?")
```

We can run `.exs` by passing the pathname to the `elixir` command.

```bash
â€º elixir my_script.exs

Hello, from Elixir
...a scripting language?
```

[This article](https://thinkingelixir.com/2019-04-running-an-elixir-file-as-a-script/) covers more of how this works and some of the downsides. One downside not mentioned in the article is the inability to use packages. Since `exs` scripts are not intended to be complicated programs it makes sense this was not mentioned.
