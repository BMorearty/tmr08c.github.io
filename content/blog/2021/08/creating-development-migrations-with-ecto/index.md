I have recently begun working on a greenfield Elixir and Phoenix application. Inspired by the `setup` script used by my previous team and GitHub's [Script To Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) repository, I set out to create a [`setup`](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all#scriptsetup) script (and others) for this new application.

While creating the scripts, I hit an issue automating setting up [PostgreSQL Extensions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/external-extensions.html). While it's relatively easy to add an extension to PostgreSQL (see [`CREATE EXTENSION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html)), doing this in an [`Ecto.Migration`](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_sql/Ecto.Migration.html) wouldn't work for us. In following the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege), the Postgres role/user used in deployment does not have the access required to run the `CREATE EXTENSION` query; this means creating extensions in a migration would not work when running in a production environment.

I started my `setup` script journey by replicating the manual extension creation workflow. To do this, I used the `--command` flag with the [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) command-line tool to run our specified queries.

```bash
# script/setup
mix ecto.create
psql --command="CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXIST my_extension"
mix ecto.migrate
```

While we eventually got something that worked, it was brittle. It required using our new scripts and didn't work well with our [`mix ecto.setup` alias](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/e221f88083779a4055bddf3d268f5d23f474bea9/installer/templates/phx_single/mix.exs#L67).

As I was about to call it "good enough for now," I found the post, [_Automatic and Manual Migrations_](https://dashbit.co/blog/automatic-and-manual-ecto-migrations) on the Dashbit blog. The post describes scenarios in which you may want to leverage Ecto's migrations but not have them automatically run as a part of your deployment. They accomplished this using the `--migrations-path` flag for `mix ecto.migrate`.

The `--migrations-path` option enables you to look in a different directory for your migration. Thanks to [`ecto_sql` 3.4](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto_sql/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v340-2020-03-24), this flag can be included multiple times to specify _multiple_ paths to search. Furthermore, we can utilize the flag differently in different environments. In production, we can limit our migrations to the default `priv/repo/migrations` path, and, in development and testing, we can look in an additional location (maybe even one that has a migration for creating extensions ðŸ¤” ).

Using this concept as the model, I generated a migration that would set up the extensions we needed and used the `--migrations-path` to specify an alternative location to store the new migration file (I chose `priv/repo/setup_migrations`).

```bash
mix ecto.gen.migration \
  --migrations-path=priv/repo/setup_migrations \
  create_necessary_extension
```

Within the migration itself, I used the same `CREATE EXTENTION IF NOT EXIST` syntax.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.CreateNecessaryExtension do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def up do
    execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS my_extension")
  end

  def down do
    execute("DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS my_extension")
  end
end
```

_Note: because we had migrations that relied on the extension existing, I also had to update the generated migration to have a timestamp that was earlier than the dependent migrations._

To run these migrations, I copied the blog post and added a `migrate_all` alias to our `mix.exs` aliases. I then updated our `setup` and `test` aliases to use this new `migrate_all` action.

```elixir
# mix.exs

defp aliases
  [
    "ecto.migrate_all": [
        "ecto.migrate \
            --migrations-path=priv/repo/setup_migrations \
            --migrations-path=priv/repo/migrations"
    ],
    "ecto.setup": [
      "ecto.create",
      "ecto.migrate_all",
      "run priv/repo/seeds.exs"
    ],
    test: [
      "ecto.create --quiet",
      "ecto.migrate_all --quiet",
      "test"
    ]
  ]
end
```

Since our `setup` script was previously using `ecto.create` and `ecto.migrate`, I updated it to use the updated `ecto.setup` alias.

Since it will be uncommon to add setup migrations, one concern I have is forgetting to use `mix ecto.migrate_all` over the default `mix ecto.migrate`. If we do not use the `migrate_all` alias, our development environments will not be updated with the necessary setup migration.

A low-cost solution would be to communicate the need to run `mix ecto.migrate_all` to the team; this could be a note in the PR, a mention during standup, or a note in chat. While not ideal, I expect this will be rare enough to be sustainable.

However, if you are following GitHub's [Script To Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) (or something similar), you may have another option - you could update the script(s) you have to run migrations to use `mix ecto.migrate_all`. Following GitHub's pattern, [`script/update`](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all#scriptupdate) is the suggested place to run migrations after pulling down new code. If your team already has a similar script, you should be able to transparently change from `mix ecto.migrate` to `mix ecto.migrate_all`.

```{diff}
# script/update

script/bootstrap

echo "==> Updating db..."
- mix ecto.migrate
+ mix ecto.migrate_all
```

Overall, I am optimistic about this solution. I think this achieves my goal of easy project setup while having low long-term project maintenance requirements.

How does your team provide an easy setup (and environment maintenance) experience for everyone? While I am happy with the solution so far, we haven't onboarded enough people to claim success. Please reach out and share alternative options that would improve our new process.
