Emptying an Array. This may actually become more of a 


When dealing with large data sets we have found that we need to be conscious of how much data we are dealing with at a given time and how large we allow our data structures to grow. This can especially become a problem when dealing with memorized data structures (LINK TO OTHER POST) since they stick around for the life of the object. 

We have this occur when breaking data up into chunks and wanting to perform different mass updates on the data within each chunk.  

Let's say you're an online bookstore. Your database is becoming full of books that are now out of print so you decide you want to have a weekly cron job that will look for books that have a quantity of zero and haven't been updated for one month. 

'''Ruby 
Books . where(quaquantity:0, uodated_at: date.tdoay - 1.month).each do |book|
 

 You have hundreds of thousands of books so querying them all at once will take up way too much memory. 

* Maybe just a me this about uodate_all instead of looping through each and deleting
* can make another where you would have to do find each
* do another where find each and using memoized arrays 
* do clear vs setting to empty array 
* if i end up creating a bunch of test data for example look into talking about faker gem?
