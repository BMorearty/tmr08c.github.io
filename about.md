I began working with Ruby on Rails in 2012 as an intern for [ROI Revolution, Inc.](http://www.roirevolution.com/) and fell in love with developer happiness paradigm of the Ruby community.

I now work full time with Ruby on Rails developing internal applications that help make my coworkers the best at what they do.

When I am not coding I am probably climbing, walking my dog, or eating pizza.

I am passionate about software design, refactoring, optimization and the software development process.
